FAQ

**How do I use GD with a 800x480 display?**

If you're using the Gameduino 3 7" model, this is done for you by the Gameduino 3's configuration flash.
If you're using another screen the setup procedure must be done explicitly.
After calling ``GD.begin()`` you can set the scanout registers for 800x480 like this:

    GD.wr16(vc.REG_HCYCLE, 928);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_HOFFSET, 88);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_HSIZE, 800);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_HSYNC0, 0);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_HSYNC1, 48);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_VCYCLE, 525);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_VOFFSET, 32);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_VSIZE, 480);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_VSYNC0, 0);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_VSYNC1, 3);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_CSPREAD, 1);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_DITHER, 1);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_PCLK_POL, 0);
    GD.wr16(vc.REG_PCLK, 4);

**How do I use GD with a 320x480 display?**

There is a writeup here: http://excamera.com/sphinx/article-ili9488.html

**How do I use GD with the [Sunflower Shield](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cowfishstudios/sunflower-shield-35-hmi-display-w-cap-touch-for-ar#)?**

At the start of GD2.cpp change ``BOARD`` and ``CALIBRATION``:

    #define BOARD         BOARD_SUNFLOWER   // board, from above
    #define STORAGE       1                 // Want SD storage?
    #define CALIBRATION   0                 // Want touchscreen calibration?

**How do I change the select pin assignments?**

To change the GPU select from pin 8, modify ``#define CS`` at the start of ``transports/wiring.h``

To change microSD select from pin 9, modify ``#define SD_PIN`` at the start of ``GD2.cpp``

**How do you run in portrait mode?**

After calling ``GD.begin()`` set the orientation like this::

    GD.cmd_setrotate(2);

to enter portrait mode. The argument controls orientation, 0 and 1 are landscape. 2 and 3 are portrait.
